The research focus of our lab is advancing machine learning and image processing for challenging applications such as [geospatial imaging](##Multi-Scale,-Multi-Sensor-GeoAI) and [biomedicine](##AI-in-BioMedicine). Our current research focus entails development of machine learning and image processing techniques for robust analysis of multi-sensor, multi-scale, high dimensional data. Our lab is supported in part by the following sponsors: NASA, NSF, NIH, DoD and Amazon AWS.  

Here is a select list of some of our recent efforts:

## Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation

## Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Knowledge Transfer

## Image Super-Resolution

## Graph Convolutional Networks for Spatial-Spectral Image Analysis
