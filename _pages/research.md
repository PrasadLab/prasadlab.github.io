The research focus of our lab is advancing machine learning and image processing for challenging applications such as [geospatial imaging](##Multi-Scale,-Multi-Sensor-GeoAI) and biomedical data analysis. Our current research focus entails development of machine learning and image processing techniques for robust analysis of multi-sensor, multi-scale, high dimensional data. We acknowledge the following sponsors for supporting the research in our lab: NASA, NSF, NIH, DoD and Amazon AWS.
