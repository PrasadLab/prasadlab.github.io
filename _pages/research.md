The research focus of our lab is advancing machine learning and image processing for challenging applications such as geospatial imaging and biomedicine. Our current research focus entails development of machine learning and image processing techniques for robust analysis of multi-sensor, multi-scale, high dimensional data. Our lab is supported in part by the following sponsors: NASA, NSF, NIH, DoD and Amazon AWS.

Some of our current and recent research efforts are highlighted below:

## Incremental Learning for Continual Updates to Semantic Segmentation Networks

## Hybrid Convolutional and Vision Transformers for Multi-Channel Image Analysis

## Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Multi-Temporal, Multi-Sensor, Multi-Scale GeoAI
