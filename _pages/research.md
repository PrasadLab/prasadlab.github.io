The research focus of our lab is advancing machine learning and image processing for challenging applications such as [geospatial imaging](##Multi-Scale,-Multi-Sensor-GeoAI) and [biomedicine](##AI-in-BioMedicine). Our current research focus entails development of machine learning and image processing techniques for robust analysis of multi-sensor, multi-scale, high dimensional data. Our lab is supported in part by the following sponsors: NASA, NSF, NIH, DoD and Amazon AWS. 

## Multi-Scale, Multi-Sensor GeoAI

Multi-Sensor, Multi-Scale Geospatial Image Analysis is a key application focus of our lab. Modern geospatial imaging via both active and passive sensing modalities aboard platforms such as satellites as well as manned and unmanned aircraft are a double-edge-sword. On the one hand they can facilitate a remarkable understanding of the earth. On the other hand, the high dimensionality of modern multi-channel imagers, along with the limited ground truth available for remote sensing tasks make effective image analysis fraught with challenges that must be addressed.
