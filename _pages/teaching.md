A summary of recent courses offered is provided below. 

## ECE 6381: Sparse Representations for Signal Processing 
Sparse representations are a foundational tool for modern signal processing and data analysis and have a
wide range of applications, including denoising, compression, compressive sensing, machine learning
etc. for a variety of signals including speech (audio), images, and video. The course will focus on
foundations of sparse signal representations using multi-resolution analysis and wavelet theory (“a
fixed basis/representation”). Additionally, as time permits, the course will also discuss data-learned
signal representation commonly utilized in deep neural networks. We will also discuss emerging directions at the intersection of these domains, as well as the role of
sparsity in the design of efficient deep neural networks. Emerging trends in sparsity for image analysis,
that connect structured sparsity with ideas in machine learning and deep neural networks will also be
introduced. The course will have a theoretical component as well as a hands-on project component where
students will apply these techniques to a real-world image analysis problem.


## ECE 6337: Stochastic Processes in Signal Processing and Data Science
This course will cover in depth concepts related to Probability, Random Variables, and
Stochastic Processes, and will connect them to foundational elements in data science. It is
expected that the students thoroughly review the material presented in class, and keep pace
with self-study of related topics and by solving practice problems from the textbook. We will
focus on developing foundational concepts in class, along with use of examples as needed. In
addition to covering the theory behind these foundational concepts, we will link these
concepts to applications in data science and signal processing (e.g. Subspace learning,
Bayesian inference, Bayesian classification, clustering, denoising etc. - as time permits), and
these will be tested through a project based on Python, where students will learn how
to apply concepts learned in class on practical problems.
